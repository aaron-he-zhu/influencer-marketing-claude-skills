6. **Report Writing Best Practices**

   ```markdown
   ## Report Writing Guidelines
   
   ### Structure Principles
   
   1. **Lead with outcomes**: Start with results, not methodology
   2. **Answer "so what?"**: Every metric needs context
   3. **Use progressive disclosure**: Summary → Details → Appendix
   4. **Balance positive and constructive**: Celebrate wins, acknowledge learnings
   
   ### Writing Tips
   
   **Instead of**: "We achieved 2.4M reach"
   **Write**: "We reached 2.4M people, 20% above our target, primarily through TikTok content that resonated with Gen Z audiences"
   
   **Instead of**: "Engagement rate was 4.2%"
   **Write**: "Our 4.2% engagement rate outperformed the industry average of 3.1%, indicating content strongly resonated with our target audience"
   
   ### Narrative Arc
   
   1. **Setup**: What we set out to do
   2. **Execution**: What we did
   3. **Results**: What happened
   4. **Analysis**: What it means
   5. **Recommendations**: What to do next
   ```

## Example

**User**: "Create an executive report for our holiday campaign: $50K spend, $165K revenue, 3.5M reach across 15 influencers"

**Output**:

```markdown
# Holiday Campaign 2024: Executive Summary

## Bottom Line: Campaign Exceeded All Targets ✅

**ROI: 230%** | **ROAS: 3.3:1** | **Revenue: $165,000**

### Investment & Return

| | |
|---|---|
| Investment | $50,000 |
| Revenue | $165,000 |
| **Net Return** | **$115,000** |

### Key Results

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Revenue | $100K | $165K | ✅ +65% |
| ROAS | 2:1 | 3.3:1 | ✅ +65% |
| Reach | 2M | 3.5M | ✅ +75% |
