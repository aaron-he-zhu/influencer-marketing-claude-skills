   ```

4. **Provide Negotiation Support**

   ```markdown
   ## Negotiation Guide
   
   ### Current Situation
   
   | Factor | Details |
   |--------|---------|
   | Influencer | @[handle] |
   | Their ask | $[X] |
   | Our budget | $[Y] |
   | Gap | $[Z] |
   | Deliverables | [what they'd provide] |
   
   ### Negotiation Strategies
   
   **Strategy 1: Value Exchange**
   
   Instead of increasing cash, offer additional value:
   
   | Offer | Value | Script |
   |-------|-------|--------|
   | Extended usage rights | [$X value] | "We'd love to feature your content on our channels too – would whitelisting rights for [duration] help bridge the gap?" |
   | Additional product | [$X value] | "We can include [additional products] worth $[X] for you and your audience" |
   | Affiliate commission | [%] | "What if we added [X%] commission on sales through your code?" |
   | Long-term commitment | [future value] | "If this goes well, we'd love to make you an ambassador with guaranteed [X] partnerships per year" |
   
   ---
   
   **Strategy 2: Scope Adjustment**
   
   Modify deliverables to fit budget:
   
   | Original Ask | Modified Scope | Budget Fit |
   |--------------|----------------|------------|
   | 1 Reel + 3 Stories | 1 Reel only | Reduces cost [%] |
   | Dedicated video | Integration mention | Reduces cost [%] |
   | Exclusive content | Non-exclusive | Reduces cost [%] |
   
   **Script**: "We really want to work with you but $[X] is above our budget for this campaign. Would you be open to [modified scope] for $[Y]?"
   
   ---
   
   **Strategy 3: Future Value**
   
   Emphasize long-term relationship potential:
   
   **Script**: "While we can't meet $[X] for this campaign, we're building a roster of long-term partners. Starting at $[Y] would let us prove the ROI internally and open doors to bigger budgets and more frequent partnerships. Would that work?"
   
   ---
   
   ### Negotiation Scripts
   
   **Their ask is too high:**
   
   "Thank you for getting back to me with your rates. We love your content and really want to make this work. Our budget for this campaign is $[Y]. Is there flexibility on your end, or could we adjust the scope to make it fit? We're also happy to discuss additional value like [whitelisting/affiliate/long-term]."
   
   **They want more deliverables:**
   
   "We'd be happy to discuss adding [deliverable]. For the additional content, we could offer an extra $[X], bringing the total to $[Y]. Does that work for you?"
   
   **They're hesitant about the brand:**
   
   "I completely understand wanting to make sure it's the right fit. Here's what some other creators have said about working with us: [testimonials]. We prioritize creator relationships and creative freedom. Would it help to have a quick call to discuss the campaign?"
   
   **They want exclusivity:**
   
   "Exclusivity is definitely something we can discuss. For [duration] exclusivity in [category], we could increase the compensation to $[X]. Would that work?"
   
   ---
   
   ### Common Objections & Responses
   
   | Objection | Response |
   |-----------|----------|
   | "Your rate is too low" | [Value exchange or scope adjustment] |
   | "I don't do sponsored content" | "We're actually looking for authentic integrations, not ads. Full creative control..." |
   | "I've never heard of your brand" | "We're [brief credibility]. Here's some of our past work with [influencers]..." |
   | "Bad timing right now" | "Totally understand. Can I check back in [timeframe]? When would be better?" |
   | "I need to check with my manager" | "Of course! Happy to send over a formal proposal. What email should I use?" |
   | "I only work with my agency" | "Great! What's the best contact there? I'll reach out directly." |
