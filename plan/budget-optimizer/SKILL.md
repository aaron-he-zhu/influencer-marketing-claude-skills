   ```markdown
   ## Budget Optimization Strategies
   
   ### Cost Reduction Strategies
   
   | Strategy | Potential Savings | Trade-offs |
   |----------|-------------------|------------|
   | Negotiate multi-post deals | 15-25% | Commitment required |
   | Product-only compensation | 50-80% | Limited to nano/small micro |
   | Affiliate-heavy model | Variable | Performance-dependent |
   | Long-term ambassadors | 20-30% | Less variety |

   | Off-peak timing | 10-20% | Less competitive periods |

      - Typical savings: 15-20%
   
   2. **Usage rights negotiation**: Get more rights for budget
      - Include: Whitelisting, repurposing rights
      - Value add without major cost increase
   
   3. **Performance incentives**: Align interests
      - Base fee + performance bonus
      - Motivates quality content
   
   4. **Content amplification**: Boost top performers
      - Allocate 10-20% for paid amplification
      - Extend reach of best content
   
   5. **UGC rights**: Maximize content value
      - Negotiate perpetual rights
      - Repurpose across channels
   
   ### Budget Red Flags
   
   ⚠️ **Warning Signs**:
   - >40% of budget on single influencer
   - CPM significantly above industry average
